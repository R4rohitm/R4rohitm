 <h1 align="center"> Hi there üëã I'm Rohit Mahajan</h1>

<h5 align="left">I'm a Full Stack Web Developer (MERN) based in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. I'd say I'm a passionate developer who loves coding. </h5>
<h5 align="left">  I always thought my dream was to be a proofreader for a little publishing company, sipping my coffee and reading the opening lines to the next best-selling novel. It seemed like an appropriate dream given my MA in English. I gravitated toward proofreading and quality control positions. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.

And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked play on my first Python tutorial video. (I mean seriously, how could it not be great when it's named after Monty Python's Flying Circus?) Since then, I can't get enough. Front-end web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).

I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.</h5>
